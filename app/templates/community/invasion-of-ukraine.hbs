        What is happening in Ukraine?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-hero-base mb-2">
        Right now, the world's media is focused upon Ukraine.
        We understand that not all people may know what is happening in Ukraine.
        We have collected information to help you better understand what the Ukrainian people are
        now experiencing.

        <li class="text-hero-base mb-2">
          On February 24th, around 5 a.m., the Russian military began the full-scale military invasion of Ukraine based on orders from Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia.
        </li>
        <li class="text-hero-base mb-2">
          Russian troops launched missile strikes against Ukrainian cities from various directions, including
          the temporarily occupied Donbas and Crimea and the northeastern region.
        </li>
        <li class="text-hero-base mb-2">
          The Russian military has attacked Ukranian military and other strategically critical infrastructure across the country.
          Borders are violated from the north, east, and the administrative border with Crimea.
          The Ukrainian Armed Forces are retaliating; there are casualties on both sides.
        </li>
        <li class="text-hero-base mb-2">
          This is an act of war, an attack on Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a gross violation of the UN
          Charter and international law's fundamental norms and principles.
          Accordingly, Ukraine has activated its right to self-defense under international law.
        </li>
        <li class="text-hero-base mb-2">
          The Ukrainian people ask the world to respond as strongly as possible to what is happening. Ukraine calls on
          international partners to immediately apply a new round of meaningful sanctions against Russia.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-hero-base mb-2">
       Although Russia's President Vladimir Putin has called the invasion a military operation, it meets the criteria of war.
       Ukraine needs the help of foreign governments, but there are things that any civilian in any country can do to help.
